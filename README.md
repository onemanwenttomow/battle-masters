# Battle Masters

I attempted to rebuild a childhood fav game using Nuxt.js and sockets. Not really styled at all, but most of the functionality works. You can add pieces to the baord, card based turns. Pieces can move, or "shoot" at a distance. Combat taken care of as well as "special" cards such as the canon, and the extra movement for the knights and wolf riders.
